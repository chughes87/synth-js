# Claude Notes

## Workflow

- Work in small, focused increments — each task gets its own PR
- Before starting any multi-step task, add it to `PLAN.md` as a checklist and keep it updated as you go
- Check `PLAN.md` at the start of each session to see if there is in-progress work to continue
- If a task turns out to be large, break it into smaller sub-tasks in `PLAN.md`, complete only the first sub-task, and stop — do not attempt the remaining sub-tasks
- Mark items `[x]` in `PLAN.md` as they are completed so other agents can pick up where you left off
- PRs should be small and focused — one logical change per PR, targeting `main`

## Commands

```bash
npm test          # run Jest test suite
```

## Testing

- Tests live in `tests/` mirroring the source structure
- CI runs tests on every push to main (must pass before deploy)
- Include tests in the same PR as the code they cover — don't defer them to a separate PR

## Stack

- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no frontend dependencies
- `src/` — browser JS and CSS
